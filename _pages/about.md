Hello! My name is Ben. I'm a self-taught software developer and passionate problem solver, driven to make an impact with code. I started writing code in 2022, motivated by boredom with my career and the desire to engage my mind more deeply. What began as tepid interest grew into an obsession with becoming a better programmer. Since then, I've been purposefully working toward that goal.
